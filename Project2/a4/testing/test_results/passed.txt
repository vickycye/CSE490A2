   • ProjectAlpha: 6 members (['large7_m3', 'large7_m1', 'large7_m6', 'large7_m4', 'large7_m2', 'large7_m5'])
   • ProjectEpsilon: 1 members (['large7_m7'])
   ✓ Large subteam 7 properly split: [6, 1] (will be combined into valid teams)

Large subteam 8 (8 members) split into 2 team(s):
   • ProjectBeta: 6 members (['large8_m2', 'large8_m1', 'large8_m5', 'large8_m6', 'large8_m3', 'large8_m4'])
   • ProjectEpsilon: 2 members (['large8_m8', 'large8_m7'])
   ✓ Large subteam 8 properly split: [6, 2] (will be combined into valid teams)

Normal subteam 5 (5 members):
   ✓ Stayed together on one team: ProjectGamma

Normal subteam 6 (6 members):
   ✓ Stayed together on one team: ProjectDelta

OVERALL ANALYSIS:
   Total teams formed: 6
