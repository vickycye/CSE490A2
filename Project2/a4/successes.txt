To start the project, I went through my Assignment 3 code and added comments to make sure I 
fully understood how everything worked, just like the spec suggested. While reviewing, I noticed 
that the algorithm still handles standard cases well, and it correctly combines individual students 
into teams.

When writing tests, I kept AI-generated inline comments in all caps and wrote my own in lowercase 
to keep things clear. I also told the AI not to generate method-level comments, so I wrote those 
myself, and it actually listened.

I made a test case that was good enough to make the first test fail, and from there Claude helped 
me fix the code. Test 2 passed without issues, which showed the original logic was pretty solid.

Iâ€™ll be honest: writing tests took way longer than I expected. I planned to write more, but I 
focused on a smaller number so I could document them clearly for easier grading. Near the deadline, 
I used Cursor to quickly add the remaining tests, and the whole project ended up taking around 
five hours total. I also went back through the code myself to make sure nothing was obviously wrong.
